# 🌿 EcoGuard Pro: Advanced Environmental Intelligence

**EcoGuard Pro** is a high-fidelity, dual-mode surveillance platform designed for the **Green Hackathon 2026**. It leverages Cutting-edge AI (YOLOv8 & ResNet50) to combat illegal dumping and deforestation, providing government authorities with a tactical command center for environmental protection.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. 🛰️ Dual-Mode AI Inference Engine
*   **Deforestation Analysis**: Utilizes a proprietary **ResNet50** architecture to compute vegetation indices and quantify forest loss from satellite/aerial multispectral data.
*   **Landfill Detection**: Implements a tactical **YOLOv8** model trained specifically on industrial waste and illegal dump imagery to identify pollution hotspots in seconds.

### 2. 🏛️ Government Command Center
*   **Tactical Dashboard**: A centralized intelligence hub for officials to monitor real-time environmental alerts.
*   **Smart Filtering**: Advanced sector-based (Landfill/Deforestation) and risk-level (Critical/High/Medium) filtering.
*   **Operational Response**: Ability to "Dispatch Response Units" directly from the terminal with live deployment tracking.
*   **Intelligence Briefs**: Detailed incident logs featuring AI confidence scores, geospatial coordinates (Lat/Lng), and automated telemetry generation.

### 3. 🔐 Secure Authentication Framework
*   **Official Terminal**: Verified access for government officials requiring institutional institutional credentials (`.gov.in`, `.nic.in`).
*   **Citizen Access**: A community reporting module for ecological monitoring.
*   **Protected Routing**: Neural-sync authentication ensuring data integrity and system security.

### 4. 🎨 Premium "Green Hackathon" UI
*   **Atmospheric Design**: Modern Glassmorphic interface with a deep-space emerald theme.
*   **Cinematic Experience**: Parallax hero sections with autonomous scanning animations and tactical data overlays.
*   **Responsive Architecture**: Fully optimized for mobile and desktop surveillance.
